<p>I realized it when I was traveling in a town which lies on the coast on Mediterranean sea, called Malaga. </p>
<p>I found that the first two years of my University I am in the first kind of state. You just finish your work and exam, get a good mark, and then you can just do whatever you want. Actually, you don’t really have to think about this society and how the economy goes, how the future will change and how you gonna make choice.</p>
<p>The life in European small town is the same. You get a job, and you don’t have to worry about what you should do, because everything is arranged, everyday you get to the company and there is work waiting there. </p>
<p>And after work you just do what you want, lie on the beach chill in a bar along the coast. You feel really happy because you are not worrying about anything. Someone has already make the decision for you, you just finished the work and that’s it.</p>
<p>But there is another life style which you have to worry about yourself everyday, you gonna make choice you know, and you gonna decide what to do next. </p>
<p>Like many people graduate they are very confused because they used to be arranged by school. They don’t have to make decision but now they don’t know how to choose. And this makes them anxious and painful. So does people to do a start up. Like Chinese elites, they desperately want to get much money and fab material by individual struggle. </p>
<p>Personally, I think this is not an easy multiple choice question to do. You may get bored from the arranged life, but you may also be struggle in the free life. However, the most interesting part about life is that life is uncertain. Only when you have experienced all the ups and downs can you reward a fully completed life. I think that’s why Truman has finally decide to go out his Utopia and see the real world.</p>
